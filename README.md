# EmSys: Practice Exam
This repository contains the EmSys practice exam, solutions, and videos going through each question.

As the content of the course has been changed this year I've decided to release a practice exam. I highly recommend that when starting to revise for this course that you start with this exam. Instead of giving a longer revision lecture on this, I've decided to change my approach, making three smaller videos on each of the questions. I will then host an extended office hours during the regular EmSys lab slot where you can come and ask me questions if you are struggling.

My approach to using the practice exam would be:

1. __Try the practice exam question__
2. __Look over the model answers and then try again__
3. __Watch the video and try again__
4. __Contact me / come to the office hours__

The office hours will be during the usual Friday EmSys lab slots (15:00 - 18:00), please contact me first to book a time when we can meet.
